# Credit_Score_Risk_Prediction
An interactive Streamlit web app that predicts credit risk using a machine learning model and visualizes applicant data with dynamic charts.
This project delves into the analysis of the German Credit Dataset, aiming to uncover patterns and factors influencing credit risk. By examining various personal and financial attributes of loan applicants, we strive to build predictive models that can assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises 1,000 entries, each representing a loan applicant. Key features include:

Age: Applicant's age in years.

Sex: Gender of the applicant.

Job: Job category (0 to 3).

Housing: Housing status (own, rent, free).

Saving accounts and Checking account: Financial account statuses.

Credit amount: Loan amount requested.

Duration: Duration of the loan in months.

Purpose: Reason for the loan.

Project Workflow
1.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for analysis.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships to gain insights into the factors affecting credit risk.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features and selecting relevant ones to improve model performance.

Model Building: Implementing classification models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to predict credit risk.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

Getting Started
To replicate this analysis:

Clone the Repository:

[git clone https://github.com/yourusername/German-Credit-Data-Analysis.git]

[cd German-Credit-Data-Analysis]

Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:
